# ABAG - GO task
This repo contains the implementation for the alternating trees problem specified in the task.

## Setting Up
**Note**: Uses [Go 1.17+](https://golang.org/dl/)
Ensure that you have Golang installed on your system

## Testing

```
go test
```

~ Test cases are specified in the "abag_test.go" file. 

**Note**: Ensure that test coverage is always at 100%
## Examples

```
gardenRow := []int{1,2,3,4,5}
count := abag.Solution(gardenRow)
fmt.Println(count)
```

The "solution" method returns the possible number of trees to cut down for the garden to be aesthetically pleasing.

## Go DOC
```
package abag // import "personal/abag"

Package abag provides the solution function for the alternating trees
problem.

FUNCTIONS

func Solution(a []int) int
    Solution returns the number of ways of cutting out one tree if given an
    array a consisting of n integers, where A[K] denotes the height of the K-th
    tree, so that the remaining trees are aesthetically pleasing. If it is not
    possible to achieve the desired result, it returns âˆ’1. If
    the trees are already aesthetically pleasing without any removal then it returns 0.
```
